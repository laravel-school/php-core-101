# PHP Core 101

The main goal is to (Re-)understand the PHP Core concepts that will help you to boost your skills and understand the PHP language in a better way.

# What is ...?

## [Class in PHP?](examples/what-is/class.php)
A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). 
The user-defined objects are created using the class keyword.

## [Object in PHP?](examples/what-is/class.php)
An object is a data type which stores data and information on how to process that data. 
In PHP, an object must be explicitly declared.

## [Method in PHP?](examples/what-is/class.php)
A method is a function that is a member of a class. 
In an object-oriented program, you can send a message to an object, asking it to execute one of its methods.

## [Property in PHP?](examples/what-is/class.php)
A property is a member variable of a class. 
It is a variable that holds data associated with the class and its objects.

## [Inheritance in PHP?](examples/what-is/inheritance.php)
Inheritance is a mechanism in which **one class acquires the property of another class**. 
For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. 
With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class.

## [Interface in PHP?](examples/what-is/interface.php)
An interface is a contract that specifies the methods a class should implement.

## [Abstract Class in PHP?](examples/what-is/abstract.php)
An abstract class is a class that contains at least one abstract method.

## [Trait in PHP?](examples/what-is/traits.php)
A Trait is a group of commonly used methods that can be used in a class.
